/**
 * The BinarySearchStrategy is one possible strategy to handle conflicts in a LinearSpec
 * for which a solution has to be found. The strategy starts by trying to solve one the
 * problem for all given constraints. If the problem cannot be solved, i.e. the error of
 * some of the constraints does not converge to 0.0, it divides the sorted list of constraints
 * in two parts. One with constraints with higher penalties (l1) and
 * one with smaller penalties (l2). Than it tries to find a solution for the list with the
 * higher penalties. If a solution can be found for l1 it takes the half of the remaining
 * list l2 and adds these constraints to l2 and tries to solve that new list l3. If l3 can
 * be solved it adds again the half of the remaining list and so on. If it cannot be solved
 * it divides the half from l2 to l3 and adds that to l2 and tries to solve that.
